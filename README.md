> **1 Problem statement**\
> Basketball is a popular sport around the world due to the amount of
> uncertainty in each game. Upsets
>
> happen all the time and every team has a high chance to win any game.
>
> The aim of this research is to find out whether it is possible to
> predict the result of a whole season match on the basis of the
> statistical performances of the teams during their last matches.
>
> The desired output consists in predicting which team will win and the
> chances as a confidence estimate.
>
> In contrast to other projects which mostly make predictions on the
> basis of the play-off stronger data, this project will try to get good
> results based on the whole NBA season in line with other significant
> papers.
>
> A complete overview of the project including the source code is
> available and can be viewed on Github on the paper pdf.
